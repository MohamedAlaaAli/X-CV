# README: Understanding Explainability Techniques in Computer Vision

## Introduction
This README serves as a guide to understanding explainability techniques in computer vision, focusing on saliency maps, Grad-CAMs (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping), and Class Activation Maps (CAM).

## 1. Saliency Maps
- **Overview:** Saliency maps highlight the most important regions in an image that contributed to the model's prediction.
- **How it Works:** Saliency maps are generated by computing the gradient of the model's output with respect to the input image. High gradient regions indicate areas of high importance.
- **Applications:** Useful for understanding model behavior and debugging, particularly in object detection and classification tasks.

## 2. Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping)
- **Overview:** Grad-CAM is an enhancement of CAM that produces class-discriminative localization maps without requiring architectural changes or retraining.
- **How it Works:** Grad-CAM computes the gradients of the target class score with respect to feature maps in the final convolutional layer. These gradients are used to weigh the importance of each feature map, generating a heat map highlighting important regions.
- **Applications:** Used for visualizing and interpreting CNN-based models, particularly in image classification and object localization tasks.

## 3. Class Activation Maps (CAM)
- **Overview:** CAM generates localization maps to highlight discriminative image regions used for classification.
- **How it Works:** CAM utilizes global average pooling to obtain the class-specific output of the final convolutional layer. The resulting class scores are combined with the feature maps to produce the localization map.
- **Applications:** CAM is useful for understanding where a CNN looks when making predictions and can aid in model debugging and interpretation.

## Conclusion
Explainability techniques such as saliency maps, Grad-CAM, and CAM provide insights into the inner workings of deep learning models, making them more interpretable and trustworthy. By visualizing model decisions and highlighting important image regions, these techniques enhance model understanding, debugging, and trustworthiness in various computer vision applications.
